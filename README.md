### :information_source: The System and its Purpose
The system is an attendance monitoring software that tracks which employees are clocked in at LGU-CDO and at what time. In almost any organization, keeping tabs of an individual’s attendance is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it helps in determining the overall performance of employees. Through the recorded timestamps in the system, the total number of hours rendered by an employee on a daily basis can be tracked. This will then help employers in calculating the total compensation to be given at the end of the month. The system will also aid in measuring the absenteeism rate of employees. Consequently, this will allow the management to determine when to replace an employee if the reports show that their absence to work incur costs and problems in the overall performance of an organization. Also, due to the pandemic, many organizations, including LGU-CDO, have partially switched to remote setup. The attendance monitoring system may then help in managing remote workers. Instead of manually reporting to the management the number of work hours they have spent at home, they can just simply access the monitoring system remotely, sign in, and add their attendance information. Another notable advantage of the system is that it provides transparency between employees and employers because their attendance record is easily accessible in the system. Should concerns arise, they can just simply view their records in the system at any time. Not to mention, this will also lessen the workload for the management because they won’t have to spend any more time looking for attendance sheets in their file folder racks.
